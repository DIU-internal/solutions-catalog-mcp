# DIU Solutions Catalog MCP

An MCP server that makes successful DIU prototypes easier to find in the
[DIU Commercial Solutions Catalog](https://www.diu.mil/solutions/portfolio/catalog).
It turns the public catalog into a searchable, citation-ready resource for discovering
capabilities by mission need, vendor, focus area, or completion year.

## Architecture and deployment

The Python [FastMCP](https://gofastmcp.com/) application exposes seven read-only catalog
tools. It searches a local CSV snapshot through an embedded Qdrant vector index, with a
local FastEmbed model cache. Qdrant is embedded in the server process; it is not a separate
database service.

Use the deployment path that fits the client:

- **Local MCP client:** run the server over stdio.
- **Local or hosted HTTP:** run Streamable HTTP at `/mcp` on port `8001`.
- **Container host or DGX:** build the Docker image; optionally place nginx in front for a
  trusted-network or public HTTPS endpoint.

The Docker image includes the catalog CSV, Qdrant index, and embedding model, so normal
container starts do not download or build those assets. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)
for commands and hosting guidance.

## Data pipeline

The project provides a reproducible pipeline that:

1. Fetches every catalog entry from DIU's public catalog and detail APIs.
2. Writes the complete data set to one CSV, including plain text and original HTML fields.
3. Embeds the records with FastEmbed and persists them in an embedded Qdrant database.
4. Exposes semantic search, exact lookup, browsing, facets, and status through FastMCP.
5. Runs locally over stdio or as a hosted MCP Streamable HTTP service.

## Quick start

Python 3.10 or newer and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) are recommended.

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run diu-catalog-scrape
uv run diu-catalog-ingest
uv run diu-catalog-mcp
```

To run the remote HTTP server instead:

```bash
uv run diu-catalog-web
```

This exposes the MCP server at `http://localhost:8001/mcp`. See
[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for Docker, cloud hosting, ChatGPT connection, health checks,
and optional bearer-token protection.

The default MCP transport is stdio. Add it to an MCP client with:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "diu-solutions": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["--directory", "/absolute/path/to/solutions-catalog-mcp", "run", "diu-catalog-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Scrape the full catalog:

```bash
uv run diu-catalog-scrape --output data/diu_solutions_catalog.csv
```

The command validates DIU's reported total, fetches each detail record concurrently with retries,
and atomically replaces the CSV only after the scrape succeeds. The CSV columns are:

- `uuid`, `project_name`, `vendor_name`, `portfolio`, `year_completed`
- `dod_partners`, `key_terms`, `problem`, `solution`
- `key_terms_html`, `problem_html`, `solution_html`
- `source_url`, `scraped_at`

Build or rebuild the vector database:

```bash
uv run diu-catalog-ingest \
  --csv data/diu_solutions_catalog.csv \
  --db data/qdrant
```

The default embedding model is `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` (384 dimensions). It is downloaded on
the first ingestion. Rebuilding replaces the collection only after the CSV and first embedding
have been validated.

## MCP tools

- `search_solutions`: semantic search by mission need, capability, problem, or keyword; supports
  exact portfolio, vendor, and year filters.
- `get_solution`: retrieve a full project by DIU UUID.
- `list_solutions`: browse and filter the catalog with pagination.
- `catalog_facets`: list focus areas, vendors, and years with counts.
- `catalog_status`: report data paths and CSV/vector record counts.
- `search`: ChatGPT company-knowledge/deep-research compatible semantic search.
- `fetch`: ChatGPT-compatible full record retrieval by search-result ID.

Example discovery requests:

- "Find solutions for resilient communications in disconnected environments."
- "Show autonomous maritime systems completed in 2025."
- "Which catalog entries address zero-trust access or identity management?"

## Configuration

Environment variables override the defaults:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DIU_CATALOG_CSV` | `data/diu_solutions_catalog.csv` | Scraped catalog CSV |
| `DIU_QDRANT_PATH` | `data/qdrant` | Embedded Qdrant storage directory |
| `DIU_COLLECTION` | `diu_solutions` | Qdrant collection name |
| `DIU_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` | FastEmbed model |
| `DIU_MODEL_CACHE` | `data/models` | Persistent embedding model cache |

## Development

```bash
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
```

The scraper tests use mocked HTTP responses. The vector test uses a deterministic in-memory test
embedder, so the test suite does not download a model.

## Data provenance

All catalog content comes from DIU's public website/API and remains attributable through each
row's `source_url`. Re-run the scraper and ingestion commands to refresh the local snapshot.
